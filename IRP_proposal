Title: Has Trade Truly Shifted from China to Turkey? Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 on Turkey's Exports
The COVID-19 pandemic affected trade costs and trade patterns. Transportation costs have increased, stock capabilities have changed dramatically, container problems have arisen, and international trade has had to adapt. This paper aims to analyze the potential trade shifts that have occurred in the post-COVID period and their impacts on Turkey's export. Primarily, the study examines the popular argument that Turkey has benefited from China's market share loss due to the pandemic and investigates this claim by analyzing the trade patterns. The paper contributes to the literature by providing insights into the potential impacts on Turkey's export market and the factors that may have contributed to these changes. The study is conducted using panel regression, covering 2002 to 2021 and involving 200 country pairs.
