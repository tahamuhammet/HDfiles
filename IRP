This paper aims to explore the potential trade shifts that have occurred in the post-COVID period and their impacts on Turkey's export market. Specifically, the study examines the popular argument that Turkey has benefited from China's lost market share due to the pandemic, and evaluates this claim by analyzing the trade patterns between Turkey and other countries. The paper contributes to the literature by providing insights into the potential impacts on Turkey's export market and the factors that may have contributed to these changes.

The study is conducted using panel regression, covering the period from 2002 to 2021 and involving 200 country pairs. To account for price and trade cost effects that arose during the COVID-19 period, the share of countries in total exports is calculated by dividing their exports to the importing country by the total exports to that country by other countries in a given year. This method helps to better understand the influence of a particular country on the importing country's exports.
